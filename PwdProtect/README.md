# PwdProtect snippet #

This shows a simple _login_ dialog box to allow the user to type a password before entering the application.

The default password is **wxWidgets** and the user has 3 attemps to type in this word.

These 2 things are customizable (see the parameters given in the _**DlgLogin**_ class constructor)
