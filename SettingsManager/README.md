# SettingsManager snippet #

wxWidgets singleton class to manage an application's settings.

On Windows and Linux, this application can be made _portable_ by creating an empty text file named "_**settings**_" (without any extension) in the folder of the executable.

Please note that the tip above isn't yet implemented for the wxPython version
