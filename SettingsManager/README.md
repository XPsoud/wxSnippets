# SettingsManager snippet #

wxWidgets singleton class to manage an application's settings.

On Windows and Linux, this application can be made _portable_ by creating an empty text file named "_**settings**_" (without any extension) in the folder of the executable.

Please note that the tip above isn't yet implemented for the wxPython version

Also note that despite the option is present (and read/saved from the settings file), the _Compress settings file_ options isn't implemented yet for the wxPython version of this snippet.
